# MTB Nynäshamn

The main purpose of this website is to form a MTB community in the city of Nynäshamn, in the southern region of the Stockholm Metropolitan Area. 

Even though the number of cyclists has grown exponentially over the past 4 years, Nynäshamn still lacks a community of cyclists that is brought together by the love of this sport and the willingness to explore the Swedish nature in a different manner.

Besides this, 


## User Experience (UX)

* ### User Stories
    * **First Time Visitor Goals**

        a. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        b. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

        c. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

    * **Returning Visitor Goals**

        a. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about coding challenges.

        b. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        c. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.

    * **Frequent User Goals**

        a. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

        b. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

        c. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.


* ### Design

    * **Colour Scheme**
        The two main colours used are light slate grey and yellow green.

    * **Typography**

    The two main fonts used are Oswald (headers) and Roboto (body), with Sans Serif as a fallback.

    * **Imagery**
    Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.


* ### Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## #Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
