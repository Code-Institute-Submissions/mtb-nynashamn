# **MTB Nynäshamn**

![Mockup](assets/images/Mockup.jpg)

Even though the number of cyclists has grown exponentially over the past 4 years, Nynäshamn still lacks a community of cyclists that is brought together by the love of this sport and the willingness to explore the Swedish nature in a different manner.

The main purpose of this website is to form a MTB community in the city of Nynäshamn, in the southern region of the Stockholm Metropolitan Area. 

The website mostly targets beginners of different ages and backgrounds. Hence, the code of conduct (which also serves as a reminder for the intermediate or advanced users), necessary equipment and the trails graded by colours with the suitable explanations. 

Needless to say, everyone is welcome to our MTB sessions, as long as they have a bike with sound brakes, a helmet and a wish to join a lovely community. 


## **User Experience (UX)**

* ### **User Stories**
    * **Visitor Goals**

        a. As a mountain biking beginner, I want to use the site for information regarding the equipment I will be needing, the rules I must follow and the types of trails I will be visiting.  

        b. As a person who has recently moved to Nynäshamn, I want to use the site in order to pick up a new hobby, join the community and get to know the area where I am living. 

        c. As a middle aged woman, I want to use the site to join the events and get in shape, while also spending quality time with my kids/family.
