# **MTB Nyn채shamn**

Even though the number of cyclists has grown exponentially over the past 4 years, Nyn채shamn still lacks a community of cyclists that is brought together by the love of this sport and the willingness to explore the Swedish nature in a different manner.

The main purpose of this website is to form a MTB community in the city of Nyn채shamn, in the southern region of the Stockholm Metropolitan Area. 

The website mostly targets beginners of different ages and backgrounds. Hence, the code of conduct (which also serves as a reminder for the intermediate or advanced users), necessary equipment and the trails graded by colours with the suitable explanations. 

Needless to say, everyone is welcome to our MTB sessions, as long as they have a bike with sound brakes, a helmet and a wish to join a lovely community.
